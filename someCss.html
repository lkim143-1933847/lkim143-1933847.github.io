            This is a photo from Aix-en-Provence, France, where I visited one summer vacation in middle school.
            I got this photo off the internet and I have no memory of going there but my parents said we went (:
            I love visiting Europe and would am planning to study abroad there next year. This paragraph of text
            is being used to show that this photo is floating left. I have never heard of this CSS property beforeâ€”
            it is very neat! I was in a data vis course last quarter where I had to pick up web dev skills, and now
            I have lots of fun learning new HTML and CSS things.
